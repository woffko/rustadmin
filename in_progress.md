# RustAdmin Windows Build Status

Date: 2026-06-23

## Current Status

Latest client/code pass is revision `006`.

What changed in this pass:

- Android/mobile Quality Monitor `Debug mode` checkbox now uses theme border/check colors, so the unchecked box is visible on dark backgrounds.
- Quality Monitor host version now uses peer `full_version` when the host advertises it, with fallback to the old plain version for older hosts.
- Mobile About now reads `bind.mainGetVersion()`, so Android shows the Rust full version with revision instead of only the package version.
- Hosts now advertise `platform_additions.full_version` on every platform and `support_capture_backend` only on Windows. The client shows the `Capture` menu only for Windows peers that advertise the capability, so old/non-Windows hosts do not expose a dead switcher.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` and `../hbb_common/rustadmin_revision.txt` were bumped to `006`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.006.apk`, size `27,826,333` bytes, sha256 `4c3c9e5651bc150e1fd269ad517b2c944c60e6f2211e5b60ce685646b5294696`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.006.zip`, size `27,229,498` bytes, sha256 `6f050bb359af9724c3566d7e8c909a11faee1616b243d7d7707f0459e3fa70ff`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.006.zip`, size `41,196,430` bytes, sha256 `ad32cf7a977e4137cb139c706826ee29d349058f81ce6303247c6d92e8e9ba43`.
- macOS client build is blocked in the current WSL2/Linux environment. `/home/w0w/flutter/bin/flutter build macos` reports that `macos` is not a supported `flutter build` subcommand here; a macOS/Xcode Flutter toolchain is required.

Verification in this pass:

- `dart analyze lib/consts.dart lib/common/widgets/toolbar.dart lib/models/model.dart lib/mobile/pages/remote_page.dart lib/mobile/pages/settings_page.dart`: passed with info/deprecation warnings only.
- Android Rust library built for `aarch64-linux-android` with `flutter,hwcodec,mediacodec`, then copied and stripped into `flutter/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/librustdesk.so`.
- Android APK verified with `apksigner verify --verbose`; `aapt dump badging` reports `versionName='2.0.2'`, `versionCode='2202'`, native code `arm64-v8a`.
- Windows archive copied back from the VM and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors.
- `cargo check --lib --no-default-features`: blocked by the same missing `gstreamer-1.0` pkg-config dependency.

Latest test build is `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004-capture-backend-menu-test.zip`.

What changed in the latest pass:

- Added a connection menu entry next to `Codec`: `Capture`.
- `Capture` supports `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI` for Windows hosts.
- `Auto` is the default and keeps the existing fallback chain. Manual choices are stored per peer and sent to the host as a capture backend preference; fallback protection remains active if the selected backend cannot produce frames.
- New clients always send `Auto` or the saved manual value during login, so a previous manual host preference does not leak into a later default session.
- The menu is shown based on the remote host platform, so Android/mobile clients can switch capture backend while connected to a Windows host.
- The host restarts the video stream after a backend change so the selected capturer takes effect immediately.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: capped server-side video frame fetch/send wait to the current frame interval, max `50 ms`. This replaces the old wait loop that could block the capture/encode loop for up to `3 seconds`.
- `src/server/connection.rs`: lowered stale queued video frame drop threshold from `3 seconds` to `200 ms`, so delayed frames are discarded instead of being played back after a stall.

Built and copied locally:

- VM archive: `C:\rustadmin\rustadmin\dist\windows\RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004.zip`
- Local copy: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004-capture-backend-menu-test.zip`
- Size: `41,193,454` bytes
- SHA256: `e2238c77593a2dde1f29ed19bdb2795072fb046d1562cf192e30d36ef1cbf74e`

Next test should check:

- open the connection toolbar display/options menu and switch `Capture` between `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI`;
- compare smoothness and Quality Monitor `HostBackend` / `HostFallback` for each backend;
- whether image movement feels smoother after a `200+ ms` delay spike;
- Quality Monitor `HostWait max` should stay near `33-50 ms` at 30 FPS;
- if `Delay` still spikes but `HostWait` is low, the remaining issue is likely network/transport jitter and may need a small client-side jitter buffer instead of more host pacing changes.

- Expected test signal: after DXGI reports `dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot`, host should try `HostBackend WGC` with `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot_wgc`. If WGC does not produce frames, it falls back to `HostBackend WinMag` with `HostFallback wgc_no_frame_mag`.

Latest rebuild after server video pacing / stale-drop smoothing test:

- `src/server/video_service.rs`: video frame send/fetch wait is capped to the current frame interval, with a hard max of 50 ms, instead of looping for up to 3 seconds. Expected test signal: `HostWait max` should stay near `33-50` ms at 30 FPS instead of spiking above 200 ms.
- `src/server/connection.rs`: stale queued video frames are dropped after 200 ms instead of 3 seconds, so the sender does not play delayed frames after a network or socket stall.
- `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.003.zip`: 41,183,825 bytes, last written `2026-06-22 21:49:40` on the VM.
- `rustadmin.exe`: 718,848 bytes, last written `2026-06-22 21:49:26` on the VM.
- Local test copy: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.003-smoothing-test.zip`, sha256 `288e52f058c3dd25bbc3a8ea8badb7e544fc6877f2f9c4902429fa4051bfabe2`.
- Next Windows test should compare smoothness and Quality Monitor `HostWait`/`Delay` before deciding whether a larger jitter buffer is needed.

Latest rebuild after capture backend menu test:

- `../hbb_common/protos/message.proto`: added `OptionMessage.capture_backend` with `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI` values.
- `../hbb_common/src/config.rs`: added persisted peer option key `capture-backend`.
- `src/client.rs`, `src/flutter_ffi.rs`, `src/ui_session_interface.rs`: added per-session save/send path for capture backend selection.
- `src/client.rs`: sends `Auto` explicitly during login when no manual backend is saved, preventing stale host preference from carrying across sessions.
- `src/server/connection.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`: host applies the selected capture backend preference and refreshes video after a change.
- `flutter/lib/common/widgets/toolbar.dart`, desktop/mobile remote option pages: added the `Capture` radio menu next to codec selection for Windows hosts.
- `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004.zip`: built successfully on the VM.
- Local test copy: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004-capture-backend-menu-test.zip`, size `41,193,454` bytes, sha256 `e2238c77593a2dde1f29ed19bdb2795072fb046d1562cf192e30d36ef1cbf74e`.
- Expected test signal: `Auto` should show the active host backend in the menu label and Quality Monitor; manual choices should switch `HostBackend` after the video refresh.

## Fixes Applied For This Build

- `src/server/video_service.rs`: DXGI startup `WouldBlock` no longer permanently falls back to GDI; host diagnostics work from the existing tree was preserved.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after Android screenshot changed DXGI startup no-frame handling from a permanent `dxgi_startup_no_frame` GDI fallback into a one-shot `dxgi_startup_gdi_snapshot`; after sending that startup GDI frame, the capturer calls `cancel_gdi()` and returns to DXGI.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after frozen-one-frame test. If DXGI still returns only `WouldBlock` for 3 seconds after the one-shot GDI startup snapshot, host now falls back to continuous GDI with `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot` instead of staying frozen on `HostBackend DXGI`.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after Administrator Protection user-token launch still produced `HostBackend GDI` + `dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot`. The final fallback now tries `scrap::CapturerMag`/Magnification API first (`HostBackend WinMag`, `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot_mag`) and falls back to recreated GDI only if WinMag cannot start or errors.
- `libs/scrap/src/dxgi/wgc.rs`, `libs/scrap/src/common/dxgi.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`: added a Windows Graphics Capture backend and changed fallback order to `DXGI -> WGC -> WinMag -> GDI`; host diagnostics now report `HostBackend WGC`.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`, `src/server/connection.rs`: low-latency smoothing test caps server-side video frame wait to one frame interval / 50 ms max and drops stale queued video frames after 200 ms to reduce visible catch-up stutter.
- `src/client.rs`, `src/server/connection.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`, Flutter toolbar/options pages: added runtime `Capture` backend selection with `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI`.
- `src/platform/windows.rs`: when Windows Administrator Protection (`TypeOfAdminApprovalMode=2`) is enabled and the target session is an interactive user session, the service now first launches `--server` from the interactive user token for DXGI compatibility. If that launch fails, it falls back to the previous privileged `winlogon.exe` token path.
- `libs/scrap/src/common/mod.rs`, `libs/scrap/src/common/dxgi.rs`: `TraitCapturer` now exposes `cancel_gdi()` so the video service can return from the temporary GDI snapshot path to DXGI, and `is_mag()` so host diagnostics can report the Magnification API backend distinctly.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt`: bumped to `004`.
- `../hbb_common/rustadmin_revision.txt`: bumped to `002`.
- `scripts/build_windows.ps1`: native command wrapper now checks exit codes without aborting on normal native stderr output.
- DVS compatibility on VM: created junctions under `C:\rustadmin\DVS\DVS\installed\x64-windows-static` for `include`, `lib`, and `bin`.
- `hwcodec` FFmpeg 62 compatibility:
  - profile macro fallback for `AV_PROFILE_*` names,
  - key-frame detection uses `AV_FRAME_FLAG_KEY`,
  - Windows static link set expanded for FFmpeg/DVS dependencies,
  - oneVPL `vpl.lib` is used instead of old `libmfx.lib`.
- Flutter on VM was switched from `3.44.2` to `3.24.5`; the newer Flutter was incompatible with current Dart code and `extended_text 14.2.2`.
