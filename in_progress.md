# RustAdmin Windows Build Status

Date: 2026-06-23

## Current Status

Latest client/code pass is revision `017`.

What changed in this pass:

- Android adaptive launcher icon background now uses `#242424`, matching the logo PNG background. This removes the visible white rounded frame and makes the inset foreground canvas blend into the adaptive icon background, so there are no visible sharp inner corners.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `017`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.017.apk`, size `26,495,864` bytes, sha256 `4b30e06329f329d941c9dfbf5b4c4aa817ce17139dc2457c382839b0f5f7c69b`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.017.zip`, size `25,914,722` bytes, sha256 `24a8e175d827e671429ad48562ce0924dd54622b9c07dc658febdbb584d800ab`.
- Android adaptive launcher icons now use an `18dp` inset wrapper around `ic_launcher_foreground`, keeping the existing artwork inside the Android adaptive-icon safe area so launcher masks do not crop the orange/logo edges.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `016`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.016.apk`, size `26,495,862` bytes, sha256 `337bb864c73c6b657556fcf36d8f36ab8ebbcc78145ff591aba38815b7354db7`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.016.zip`, size `25,912,703` bytes, sha256 `910498dec29aaf21093ebe67db50a3155b794edbfdab25009a1fc3a5aa4a84d7`.
- Quality Monitor debug mode now shows the established client transport as `Conn`. The `connection_ready` event fills it immediately from `stream_type`, and the normal quality-status event repeats `connection_type` once per second so the field survives monitor toggles and repaints.
- The displayed transport is normalized for diagnostics: `TCP`, `UDP/KCP`, `UDP/KCP IPv6`, `Relay/TCP`, or `WebSocket`.
- Path MTU is intentionally not displayed. The current client transport state does not expose a reliable path MTU, and showing the TCP write/MSS guard cap as `MTU` would be misleading.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `015`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.015.apk`, size `26,495,371` bytes, sha256 `982d7214181a4570cc55ad423bcba975897e71591cc780c94a8adc6ad4356187`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.015.zip`, size `25,913,831` bytes, sha256 `6dba5aca60840b0c1d4fc1d214033b860777c2b5faa212644c6d5f03b58a2536`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.015.zip`, size `41,221,479` bytes, sha256 `c6e8413e722a7624ceb5d33973899dd32dac1b89236e044f914b0a2781f6ec0b`.
- Follow-up from Android connection testing: revision `014` removes the remaining left-button release event from empty OS activation. Empty activation now sends only no-button wake/move events, so ordinary connects should not deliver either a right click or a left click to an unlocked host desktop.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `014`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.014.apk`, size `25,564,856` bytes, sha256 `4d3eabb7d156a69031fed4f4a25f8e273b50667a81f096e159a668c2e1a64138`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.014.zip`, size `24,993,354` bytes, sha256 `83e0ab7965b97a244981b86c4bd5fa7820079544095e920cc0b6cbbfc289be0e`.
- Android packaging follow-up: revision `012` was missing `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`, so Android failed at startup with `UnsatisfiedLinkError` while loading `librustdesk.so`. Revision `013` stages the NDK C++ shared runtime next to `librustdesk.so` in `flutter/ndk_arm64.sh`.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `013`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.013.apk`, size `25,564,561` bytes, sha256 `2c6760d82eb0f8b0b7ceeaf7163d1c695febe7ce6166d36680d434caa596ac3a`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.013.zip`, size `24,990,480` bytes, sha256 `affa8f15373328db952dfdcf79a304967236fbea5dc1ce5a0cd025f1a8a55f9d`.
- Follow-up from Android connection testing: the waiting-for-first-image timer calls `sessionInputOsPassword(..., value: '')` to activate the remote OS. The old empty activation path sent a right-click pair, which could open the host desktop context menu or steal focus during ordinary connects. Revision `012` keeps the wake-up mouse movement but sends no click unless an actual OS password is provided.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `012`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.012.apk`, size `25,259,326` bytes, sha256 `78d2bb3870b1d39464ddc6ff4f9bcaad793e7b1ad238125aff12be86a5659bcb`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.012.zip`, size `24,689,445` bytes, sha256 `f238b65ec1d4cf82843bd0b519fe661217733e8db3bc4a5ce80c822798e98240`.
- Experimental branch `codex/privileged-user-token-capture` keeps the Windows service-launched `--server` process privileged so Administrator Protection and the secure desktop path stay compatible.
- Added a Windows user-token capture helper (`--user-capture-helper`) for DXGI and WGC. The privileged server launches the helper in the current interactive session, receives CPU BGRA frames through shared memory, and marks helper capture as CPU-only so the VRAM texture path is not selected for helper frames.
- Automatic DXGI capture, manual DXGI, manual WGC, and the DXGI-to-WGC fallback now try the user-token helper first when RustAdmin is installed, running privileged, and the session is not locked/prelogin/secure-desktop; the old direct backend path remains the fallback if the helper cannot start.
- Follow-up from host logs: user-token helpers were exiting with `Access is denied` while opening the privileged server's shared-memory flink. The helper shmem file now receives an explicit ACL grant for authenticated interactive users, and the main capturer detects a dead helper so it can fail over instead of waiting forever.
- Follow-up from the next host test: the helper now opened shared memory and created DXGI, but helper DXGI could still sit in `WouldBlock` on startup because the old startup GDI snapshot path is not available on the helper capturer. Revision `010` now treats that as a backend fallback trigger and tries WGC, WinMag, then GDI instead of waiting forever. The helper log also reports first-frame and would-block status.
- Follow-up from manual backend switching: manual/fallback WGC was still checked for support in the privileged server process before launching the user-token helper, so WGC could be skipped and the stream would cycle back to WinMag. Revision `011` attempts WGC through the interactive helper first, checks direct-process WGC support only if the helper cannot be used, and logs helper eligibility, direct-process WGC support, fallback reason, helper backend requests, helper WGC support, shared-memory ACL grants, first frames, and would-block status.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `011`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.011.zip`, size `41,220,688` bytes, sha256 `88ed2c4a819022a58fe3e9b0b866c7a55a8e098fe20e0c359a44bc63ca794a34`.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `010`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.010.zip`, size `41,216,871` bytes, sha256 `a6bbebc6d20af1aa0001ded937e4b16d4d9368fc07e9ffa6ceaafc603d2e90e6`.
- Windows archive was copied back to WSL as `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.010.zip` and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `009`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.009.zip`, size `41,216,345` bytes, sha256 `c04690a2d1277167609ce9046b84a763d7c91312e9884d0c41f0d09a83c76678`.
- Windows archive was copied back to WSL as `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.009.zip` and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors.
- Revision `008` tried switching unlocked Administrator Protection sessions to an interactive user-token `--server`; logs showed WGC working, but secure desktop access still failed. Revision `009` supersedes that by keeping `--server` privileged and moving DXGI/WGC capture into the user-token helper.
- The service still tracks the effective launch mode, but this branch no longer selects the interactive-user launch mode for `--server`.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `008`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.008.zip`, size `41,213,520` bytes, sha256 `b80cebcb2ce91aaab31ce425c4b66dc387948d4c944584bee4f2cfa499649e8b`.
- Windows archive was copied back to WSL as `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.008.zip` and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors.
- Previous revision `007` restored the privileged `winlogon.exe` launch path. Revision `008` keeps that path for locked/prelogin sessions and uses an interactive user token only when it is needed for WGC in an unlocked Administrator Protection session.
- `libs/scrap/src/common/codec.rs` now treats `PreferCodec::AV1Vulkan` from current `hbb_common` as ordinary AV1 until a separate AV1 Vulkan encoder path exists, fixing the Windows build against the current shared proto.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` was bumped to `007`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.007.zip`, size `41,214,152` bytes, sha256 `61e1ba4a05d8fffd6bc897c7455594d412a34fec5916de079160e1363de0abc2`.
- Windows archive was copied back to WSL as `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.007.zip` and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors.
- Android/mobile Quality Monitor `Debug mode` checkbox now uses theme border/check colors, so the unchecked box is visible on dark backgrounds.
- Quality Monitor host version now uses peer `full_version` when the host advertises it, with fallback to the old plain version for older hosts.
- Mobile About now reads `bind.mainGetVersion()`, so Android shows the Rust full version with revision instead of only the package version.
- Hosts now advertise `platform_additions.full_version` on every platform and `support_capture_backend` only on Windows. The client shows the `Capture` menu only for Windows peers that advertise the capability, so old/non-Windows hosts do not expose a dead switcher.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt` and `../hbb_common/rustadmin_revision.txt` were bumped to `006`.
- Android release APK built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.006.apk`, size `27,826,333` bytes, sha256 `4c3c9e5651bc150e1fd269ad517b2c944c60e6f2211e5b60ce685646b5294696`.
- Android release ZIP built successfully: `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.006.zip`, size `27,229,498` bytes, sha256 `6f050bb359af9724c3566d7e8c909a11faee1616b243d7d7707f0459e3fa70ff`.
- Windows release archive built successfully on VM `192.168.189.137`: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.006.zip`, size `41,196,430` bytes, sha256 `ad32cf7a977e4137cb139c706826ee29d349058f81ce6303247c6d92e8e9ba43`.
- macOS client build is blocked in the current WSL2/Linux environment. `/home/w0w/flutter/bin/flutter build macos` reports that `macos` is not a supported `flutter build` subcommand here; a macOS/Xcode Flutter toolchain is required.

Recent verification:

- `dart analyze lib/consts.dart lib/common/widgets/toolbar.dart lib/models/model.dart lib/mobile/pages/remote_page.dart lib/mobile/pages/settings_page.dart`: passed with info/deprecation warnings only.
- Android Rust library built for `aarch64-linux-android` with `flutter,hwcodec,mediacodec`, then copied and stripped into `flutter/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/librustdesk.so`.
- Android revision `017` APK verified with `apksigner verify --verbose`; `aapt dump badging` reports `versionName='2.0.2'`, `versionCode='2202'`, native code `arm64-v8a`, and `unzip -l` shows `lib/arm64-v8a/librustdesk.so` and `lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so`. `aapt dump resources` shows `color/ic_launcher_background` as `0xff242424` and `drawable/ic_launcher_foreground_safe`; `librustdesk.so` contains `2.0.2 rev 017`.
- Windows revision `015` archive copied back from the VM and verified with `unzip -t`; no compressed data errors. `librustdesk.dll` contains `2.0.2 rev 015`, `connection_type`, and the TCP-only local connection diagnostic string.
- `cargo check --lib --no-default-features`: blocked by the same missing `gstreamer-1.0` pkg-config dependency.

Latest Windows test build is `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.015.zip`; latest Android test build is `RustAdmin_Android_Release_2.0.2.017.apk`.

Earlier capture-backend menu test details:

- Added a connection menu entry next to `Codec`: `Capture`.
- `Capture` supports `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI` for Windows hosts.
- `Auto` is the default and keeps the existing fallback chain. Manual choices are stored per peer and sent to the host as a capture backend preference; fallback protection remains active if the selected backend cannot produce frames.
- New clients always send `Auto` or the saved manual value during login, so a previous manual host preference does not leak into a later default session.
- The menu is shown based on the remote host platform, so Android/mobile clients can switch capture backend while connected to a Windows host.
- The host restarts the video stream after a backend change so the selected capturer takes effect immediately.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: capped server-side video frame fetch/send wait to the current frame interval, max `50 ms`. This replaces the old wait loop that could block the capture/encode loop for up to `3 seconds`.
- `src/server/connection.rs`: lowered stale queued video frame drop threshold from `3 seconds` to `200 ms`, so delayed frames are discarded instead of being played back after a stall.

Built and copied locally:

- VM archive: `C:\rustadmin\rustadmin\dist\windows\RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004.zip`
- Local copy: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004-capture-backend-menu-test.zip`

- SHA256: `e2238c77593a2dde1f29ed19bdb2795072fb046d1562cf192e30d36ef1cbf74e`

Next test should check:

- open the connection toolbar display/options menu and switch `Capture` between `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI`;
- compare smoothness and Quality Monitor `HostBackend` / `HostFallback` for each backend;
- whether image movement feels smoother after a `200+ ms` delay spike;
- Quality Monitor `HostWait max` should stay near `33-50 ms` at 30 FPS;
- if `Delay` still spikes but `HostWait` is low, the remaining issue is likely network/transport jitter and may need a small client-side jitter buffer instead of more host pacing changes.

- Expected test signal: after DXGI reports `dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot`, host should try `HostBackend WGC` with `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot_wgc`. If WGC does not produce frames, it falls back to `HostBackend WinMag` with `HostFallback wgc_no_frame_mag`.

Latest rebuild after server video pacing / stale-drop smoothing test:

- `src/server/video_service.rs`: video frame send/fetch wait is capped to the current frame interval, with a hard max of 50 ms, instead of looping for up to 3 seconds. Expected test signal: `HostWait max` should stay near `33-50` ms at 30 FPS instead of spiking above 200 ms.
- `src/server/connection.rs`: stale queued video frames are dropped after 200 ms instead of 3 seconds, so the sender does not play delayed frames after a network or socket stall.
- `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.003.zip`: 41,183,825 bytes, last written `2026-06-22 21:49:40` on the VM.

- Next Windows test should compare smoothness and Quality Monitor `HostWait`/`Delay` before deciding whether a larger jitter buffer is needed.

Latest rebuild after capture backend menu test:

- `../hbb_common/protos/message.proto`: added `OptionMessage.capture_backend` with `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI` values.
- `../hbb_common/src/config.rs`: added persisted peer option key `capture-backend`.
- `src/client.rs`, `src/flutter_ffi.rs`, `src/ui_session_interface.rs`: added per-session save/send path for capture backend selection.
- `src/client.rs`: sends `Auto` explicitly during login when no manual backend is saved, preventing stale host preference from carrying across sessions.
- `src/server/connection.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`: host applies the selected capture backend preference and refreshes video after a change.
- `flutter/lib/common/widgets/toolbar.dart`, desktop/mobile remote option pages: added the `Capture` radio menu next to codec selection for Windows hosts.
- `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004.zip`: built successfully on the VM.
- Local test copy: `RustAdmin_Release_2.0.2.004-capture-backend-menu-test.zip`, size `41,193,454` bytes, sha256 `e2238c77593a2dde1f29ed19bdb2795072fb046d1562cf192e30d36ef1cbf74e`.
- Expected test signal: `Auto` should show the active host backend in the menu label and Quality Monitor; manual choices should switch `HostBackend` after the video refresh.

## Fixes Applied For This Build

- `src/server/video_service.rs`: DXGI startup `WouldBlock` no longer permanently falls back to GDI; host diagnostics work from the existing tree was preserved.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after Android screenshot changed DXGI startup no-frame handling from a permanent `dxgi_startup_no_frame` GDI fallback into a one-shot `dxgi_startup_gdi_snapshot`; after sending that startup GDI frame, the capturer calls `cancel_gdi()` and returns to DXGI.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after frozen-one-frame test. If DXGI still returns only `WouldBlock` for 3 seconds after the one-shot GDI startup snapshot, host now falls back to continuous GDI with `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot` instead of staying frozen on `HostBackend DXGI`.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`: follow-up after Administrator Protection user-token launch still produced `HostBackend GDI` + `dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot`. The final fallback now tries `scrap::CapturerMag`/Magnification API first (`HostBackend WinMag`, `HostFallback dxgi_no_frame_after_snapshot_mag`) and falls back to recreated GDI only if WinMag cannot start or errors.
- `libs/scrap/src/dxgi/wgc.rs`, `libs/scrap/src/common/dxgi.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`: added a Windows Graphics Capture backend and changed fallback order to `DXGI -> WGC -> WinMag -> GDI`; host diagnostics now report `HostBackend WGC`.
- `src/server/video_service.rs`, `src/server/connection.rs`: low-latency smoothing test caps server-side video frame wait to one frame interval / 50 ms max and drops stale queued video frames after 200 ms to reduce visible catch-up stutter.
- `src/client.rs`, `src/server/connection.rs`, `src/server/video_service.rs`, Flutter toolbar/options pages: added runtime `Capture` backend selection with `Auto`, `DXGI`, `WGC`, `WinMag`, and `GDI`.
- `src/platform/windows.rs`: the Windows Administrator Protection interactive user-token launch experiment was reverted; service-launched `--server` now uses the previous privileged `winlogon.exe` launch path.
- `libs/scrap/src/common/mod.rs`, `libs/scrap/src/common/dxgi.rs`: `TraitCapturer` now exposes `cancel_gdi()` so the video service can return from the temporary GDI snapshot path to DXGI, and `is_mag()` so host diagnostics can report the Magnification API backend distinctly.
- `rustadmin_revision.txt`: bumped to `004`.
- `../hbb_common/rustadmin_revision.txt`: bumped to `002`.
- `scripts/build_windows.ps1`: native command wrapper now checks exit codes without aborting on normal native stderr output.
- DVS compatibility on VM: created junctions under `C:\rustadmin\DVS\DVS\installed\x64-windows-static` for `include`, `lib`, and `bin`.
- `hwcodec` FFmpeg 62 compatibility:
  - profile macro fallback for `AV_PROFILE_*` names,
  - key-frame detection uses `AV_FRAME_FLAG_KEY`,
  - Windows static link set expanded for FFmpeg/DVS dependencies,
  - oneVPL `vpl.lib` is used instead of old `libmfx.lib`.
- Flutter on VM was switched from `3.44.2` to `3.24.5`; the newer Flutter was incompatible with current Dart code and `extended_text 14.2.2`.
